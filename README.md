# CS361 Instructions

In my program I will be using a http post request to obtain the information that my microservice will be providing. An example call would be: 

fetch('/make_request', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },

In my program I will be using http pipeline to recieve data as well. This will be done in my app.py file that will be hosting my server.
